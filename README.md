# Analyzing Sentimental Change Across Music Eras

## Introduction

This project delves into the intriguing realm of music sentiment analysis, exploring how the emotional landscape of songs has evolved across different eras. By employing natural language processing techniques and machine learning models, we aim to uncover patterns and trends in the sentiments expressed through song lyrics.


## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:
- Analyze the sentiment expressed in song lyrics from various music eras.
- Understand how sentiment in music has changed over time.

### Methodology
To achieve our objective, we follow these steps:
1. Data Acquisition: We gather song data containing lyrics from different music eras.
2. Data Preprocessing: We clean and preprocess the lyrics data for analysis.
3. Sentiment Analysis: We employ various sentiment analysis techniques to extract sentiments from the lyrics.
4. Feature Extraction: We extract features from the lyrics data using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Bigram methods.
5. Model Building: We train machine learning models to classify sentiments based on the extracted features.
6. Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of the models and analyze the results.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (specified in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Setup
1. Install the required libraries by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Download NLTK resources by running:
   ```
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet stopwords vader_lexicon omw-1.4 averaged_perceptron_tagger
   ```

### Execution
1. Place your processed data CSV file (`processed_data.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script `sentiment_analysis.py`.
   ```
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```

### Output
- Classification reports, confusion matrices, and word clouds will be generated for sentiment visualization.
